-----------------------------------------------
immediately rinse the affected area with plenty of water and notify your instructor.

Safety goggles protect your eyes from chemical splashes, flying debris, and other hazards.

A fume hood is used to ventilate hazardous fumes and vapors away from the lab, protecting users from inhaling toxic substances.

Use a brush and dustpan to carefully collect the broken glass and dispose of it in a designated sharps container. Never use your hands.

Notify the instructor immediately, use a fire extinguisher if trained, and follow the lab’s emergency procedures.

Proper labeling prevents accidental misuse of chemicals and ensures that everyone knows the contents and associated hazards.

Use the wafting technique by gently waving your hand over the container to direct the fumes towards your nose. Never inhale directly.

Follow the lab’s specific disposal procedures, which may include using designated waste containers and following local regulations.
